# HokseonPlots

This package is mirgrated from Hokseon's fork of [JamesPlots.jl](https://github.com/Louhokseson/JamesPlots.jl).

HokseonPlots bases on [CairoMakie.jl](https://docs.makie.org/v0.22/explanations/backends/cairomakie) and provides it conjugate plotting functions for Hokseon's Julia visualization. Again, this package is not for general use, but for Hokseon's personal use. 

From my experience, this package will be failed if it's dependency verisons are outdated. So, if you were using this package, it compling denpendencies are failed, please check the version of the dependencies in ```Project.toml``` and ```Manifest.toml``` files.
